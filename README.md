# Freelance Driving Smart Contract

## Group members:

## Purpose of Contract:

Operating a car-for-hire business has many benefits, which include being able to set your own hours and being your own boss. However, in the current climate, this usually involves a third-party middleman used to connect you to customers who can take a significant portion of the money. This smart contract and its associated smart contracts aims to solve that issue by facilating the connection of drivers and customers while only taking a small fee to pay for network costs. This way, the driver gets to keep close to all the money the client is paying for the car ride.
